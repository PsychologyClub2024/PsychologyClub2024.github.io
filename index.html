		<p>Our club members engage in a rural community with many volunteer opportunities. Group members have worked together to do service events all around the valley, giving back to the community that we call home. One example includes an event that our members volunteered with a local organization called Project Hope, which supports victims of human trafficking, domestic violence, and more. The last 3 years, we had members serve at the annual “Stand with Me” Luncheon held by Project Hope in Crested Butte, Colorado. Serving not only bonds our members together, but it adds a new level of leadership and bonding in our chapter. Group bonding has led us to become successful student researchers as well. Many members of our chapter have begun investigating the various branches of Psychology and bringing their research to RMPA. Every year, since 2022, we have taken groups to RMPA, all of which are led by students involved in our Psychology Club or are Psi Chi members! It takes a strong team of student leaders to create a successful Psi Chi chapter, regardless of the group’s size. Working together to build connections on and off campus is crucial to our Psi Chi Chapter, as they are the backbone to the success of our group. </p></div>
